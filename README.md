# Turn ON and OFF Lights

This project demonstrates a simple web application where JavaScript is used to change the source of an image and the color of a heading when buttons are clicked. The app simulates a light switch by toggling between two images of a light bulb (on and off).

## Features

- **Interactive Buttons:** Users can turn the light bulb on or off by clicking the respective buttons.
- **Dynamic Text and Image:** The color of the heading changes to red when the light is turned on and reverts to black when the light is turned off.
- **Responsive Design:** The page is styled with centered content and is responsive to different screen sizes.

## Files

- **index.html:** The main HTML structure of the app.
- **style.css:** The CSS file used for styling the layout.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file that handles the light switch functionality.
- **pic_bulboff.gif:** The image representing the light bulb when it's turned off.
- **pic_bulbon.gif:** The image representing the light bulb when it's turned on.

## How It Works

When the "Turn ON light" button is clicked, the JavaScript function **turnOnLight()** is triggered. It changes the heading text color to red and replaces the light bulb image with the "light on" image.

When the "Turn OFF light" button is clicked, the JavaScript function **turnOffLight()** is triggered. It reverts the heading text color to black and replaces the light bulb image with the "light off" image.
